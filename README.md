# Data-Processing-and-Automation-with-Pandas-ETL-Pipeline-
The goal of this project is to help you learn how to use the Pandas library for data processing and to understand the basics of Docker and Apache Airflow.  You will use the EnergyZero API to get real energy price data for one week and build a full ETL (Extract – Transform – Load) pipeline.
